## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Devtools Performance Insights, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to:
- **Email**: [security@project.com](mailto:security@project.com)
- **Subject**: "Security Vulnerability Report - Chrome Performance Analyzer"

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
4. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
5. **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a PoC (responsibly)
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### Example Report

\\\
Subject: Security Vulnerability Report - Chrome Performance Analyzer

Description:
The file upload functionality allows uploading files larger than the configured limit, potentially leading to DoS attacks.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the upload page
2. Attempt to upload a file larger than 50MB
3. The file is processed despite the limit

Impact:
- Server resource exhaustion
- Potential denial of service
- Memory consumption issues

Affected Versions:
- v1.0.0 to v1.2.3

Proof of Concept:
[Attach minimal PoC if applicable]

Suggested Fix:
Implement server-side file size validation before processing.

## Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 7 days (for critical issues)
- **Security Release**: Within 14 days
- **Public Disclosure**: 30 days after fix release

## Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

1. **Input Validation**
   - File type validation for uploads
   - File size limits
   - JSON schema validation for performance profiles

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Strict CSP headers
   - No inline scripts or styles
   - Restricted resource loading

3. **Data Handling**
   - Client-side processing only
   - No server-side data storage
   - Secure file handling

4. **Dependencies**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Automated vulnerability scanning
   - Minimal dependency footprint

### Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

#### Input Validation
\\\typescript
// ✅ Good - Validate all inputs
function parsePerformanceProfile(file: File): PerformanceData {
  if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
    throw new Error('File too large')
  }
  
  if (!file.type.includes('json')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid file type')
  }
  
  // Additional validation...
}

// ❌ Bad - No validation
function parsePerformanceProfile(file: File): PerformanceData {
  return JSON.parse(await file.text())
}
\\\

#### Secure Data Handling
\\\typescript
// ✅ Good - Sanitize data
function displayMetricValue(value: unknown): string {
  if (typeof value !== 'number' || !isFinite(value)) {
    return 'Invalid'
  }
  return value.toFixed(2)
}

// ❌ Bad - Direct output
function displayMetricValue(value: unknown): string {
  return String(value)
}
\\\

#### Error Handling
\\\typescript
// ✅ Good - Safe error handling
try {
  const data = parseProfile(file)
  return processData(data)
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Profile parsing failed')
  throw new Error('Invalid performance profile')
}

// ❌ Bad - Exposing internal details
try {
  const data = parseProfile(file)
  return processData(data)
} catch (error) {
  throw error // May expose sensitive information
}
\\\
