# Security Scanning with Snyk

This document outlines our comprehensive security scanning setup using Snyk to protect the Devtools Performance Insights from vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Security Scanning Overview

We use **Snyk** for comprehensive security scanning across multiple dimensions:

- **🔍 Dependency Scanning**: Check npm packages for known vulnerabilities
- **📝 Code Analysis (SAST)**: Static analysis of our source code
- **🐳 Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability assessment
- **🏗️ Infrastructure as Code**: Security configuration scanning
- **📄 License Compliance**: Open source license monitoring

## 🔄 Automated Scanning Schedule

### **Continuous Integration**
- ✅ **Every Push**: Dependency and code scanning on main/develop branches
- ✅ **Every PR**: Delta scanning to catch new vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Daily**: Comprehensive security audit at 2 AM UTC
- ✅ **Release**: Full security validation before deployment

### **Monitoring**
- 📊 **Continuous Monitoring**: Snyk monitors our project 24/7
- 🚨 **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notification of new vulnerabilities
- 📈 **Trend Analysis**: Track security posture over time

## 🎯 Scanning Types & Thresholds

### **Dependency Scanning**
```yaml
Severity Threshold: HIGH
Fail Condition: Upgradable vulnerabilities
Scope: Production dependencies only
```

**What it checks:**
- Known vulnerabilities in npm packages
- Outdated packages with security fixes
- Transitive dependency vulnerabilities
- License compliance issues

### **Code Analysis (SAST)**
```yaml
Severity Threshold: MEDIUM
Scope: All TypeScript/JavaScript files
Exclusions: Test files, node_modules
```

**What it checks:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) risks
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- Insecure cryptographic practices
- Hard-coded secrets

### **Container Scanning**
```yaml
Severity Threshold: HIGH
Target: Production Docker images
Frequency: On main branch pushes
```

**What it checks:**
- Base image vulnerabilities
- Package vulnerabilities in container
- Container configuration issues
- Dockerfile best practices

### **Infrastructure as Code**
```yaml
Severity Threshold: MEDIUM
Scope: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform files
```

**What it checks:**
- Insecure container configurations
- Exposed secrets in IaC files
- Misconfigured security groups
- Weak encryption settings

4. **Testing**: Validate fix in staging environment

### **Low Severity**
1. **Backlog**: Add to security backlog
2. **Planning**: Address in regular maintenance cycles
3. **Fix**: Resolve within 30 days

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### **`.snyk` File**
```yaml
# Main Snyk configuration
language-settings:
  javascript:
    ignore-dev-deps: true
version: v1.0.0
```

### **Snyk Policy**
- **Ignore Rules**: Documented exceptions with expiration dates
- **Patch Rules**: Automatic patching preferences
- **Exclusions**: Files/directories to skip scanning
